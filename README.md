## Description

This project is an implementation of this [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.05234) with the help of this [repo](https://github.com/TropComplique/FaceBoxes-tensorflow) which proposes a solution that compines the speed and accuracy of performance for the state-of-art problem of face detection.

It is part of [Smart Exam Website](https://github.com/Smart-Exam-Website) project in which it serves the feature of detecting the faces of the present individuals in front of the camera and returns the number of faces detected to indicate if there is someone beside the student helping in cheating in the exam or not.
